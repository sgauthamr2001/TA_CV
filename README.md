//
We are a group in Computer Vision and Intelligence Club, Centre for Innovation, IIT Madras. We aim to improve the experience of road-users as well as empower traffic laws with the help of vision-based systems.
## Pedestrian Protection System
We worked on developing a system that can assist the driver to mitigate an accident before it occurs with the help of roadmap of vehicle, and other sensor data in real-time. â€‹
### Repository Guide
The repository is divided into two modules:
* Pedestrian Detection : This contains model weights and analysis of our model accuracy
* Depth estimation : This contains all files related to Monocular depth estimation
